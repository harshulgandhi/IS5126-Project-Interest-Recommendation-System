Beginnings[edit]
The Times of India issued its first edition 3 November 1838 as The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce.[7][8] The paper published Wednesdays and Saturdays under the direction of Raobahadur Narayan Dinanath Velkar, a Maharashtrian Reformist, and contained news from Britain and the world, as well as the Indian Subcontinent.
