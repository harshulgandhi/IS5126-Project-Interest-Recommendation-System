What's gonna happen on that day... “When a girl cries, it's not usually over one thing. It's built up anger and emotions that she's been holding in for too long.” All asleep😴 I wanna spend the night at the beach with you ... Beside me ... “@Blackalogy: Girls be like "it's not pink, it's....." http://t.co/UnAaM4NCOE” 👀 so pain Omg I just woke up 😱😱 “@Code_BlTCH: One day, it was perfect. The next day, it was over.” “@MeganFoxNYC: My feelings for you will never change.” I smile, laugh out loud, have fun, and get crazy with my friends. But there's always that one part missing when you're not with me. My protector was spoil last night :(( Isn't this kind of things only brothers will do for their younger sister? ☺️ I fell in love with you... not sure why or even how. #nowplaying - Love .. What to do ... Argh shouldn't have waited like a fool You're back!!! Gonna wake up Tmr earlier I wanna go to jurong library tmr and borrow some books 📕 And then go to work after that ☺️ Gonna read more books to keep myself occupy I miss my grandma :(( http://t.co/qCASvsBisB Sudden awake Trust him to send me this type of text before I eat😂😭 http://t.co/s05WMGTb78 #nowplaying - break free Ariana grande I'm at Subway in Singapore https://t.co/vdzDNBn5VG The thoughts of subway makes me feel so sick 😝😝 “Sometimes, the person who tries to keep everyone happy is often the most lonely one.” Aunty bo smelly like fuck 😝 From now on I'm just gonna find my own happiness. Not gonna care or give a damn anymore. Had a great talk with the guys just now :)) Feel like dyeing my hair again Feels so good to have friends that understands me ☺️ I guess I belong to that clique from today onwards ☺️👌 “@Code_BlTCH: We used to talk for hours. Look at us now.” 😔 changed I don't use money to buy friendships. I use : sincere , caring and understanding. Even they said the same thing as her. It's the action that makes me doubt whether you guys treat me as a friend or just a replacement to replace the "empty" feel We're still human beings. And then they came and talked to me coz they said I got left out That feeling is really priceless. I had a great talk with them. Feel like asking Michelle go eat with me 😂 You're not single anymore. I'm single , young , wild and free. Although I do have a crush on someone I really really love alot❤️🙈 To see if I actually exists in your heart. I put 100% into you because you're my best best best friend. We're grown up , we've changed. House ran out of gas during her visit last year😂 http://t.co/OTKUH86Ygk Really hungryy😭😭 I'm gonna gain so much again 😭 “@virgggo: #Virgo will take their own precious time about finding love, they're very critical and cautious in selecting a partner.” Early morning got scolded by him😂😭 http://t.co/us3xX2mfln Fuck I screwed up everything “@KarmaBlTCH: It's nice to have someone in your life who can make you smile even when they're not around.” ☺️☺️☺️ All these problems makes me doubt whether should I even date anot😕 Fucking same problem comes again.

God's greatest gift to me 💖 http://t.co/QvvJRcgnFu That's the reason why we can last so long☺️❤️ http://t.co/5lQcuIYIFJ 1 day off gone like this , but it's spent well though👍 What should I do about the both of you(??) One text me another don't. I don't even know what to do rn Why can't we just stay together and be like last time? Disgusting relationships. I won't change even if I have a boyfriend. If it's meant to be , it will be. Care for me , hug me when I'm sad. This year isn't a good year for me to date. He doesn't have to accept it. He can reject. I just want you to know that I'm waiting for you. 📞 32 minutes call with bae just now❤️☺️ http://t.co/msRm15LLWQ My pretty pigs❤️ http://t.co/2wSyWIoFXv I bet we're both in love but just shy.

I feel stupid.” Exactly!😭😭😭 Can I go back to ytd?😻 Like what brother and sister always fight who gets to reach first😉 http://t.co/2u7WII83ld Sweating even I'm in a air-conditioned train. It actually feels good knowing more guy friends than girl friends haha “@virgggo: #Virgos are the most caring friend you will ever meet. They will help you out with just about everything if you need them.” ☺️✌️ I'm so scared of being happy. Today's dinner sucks 😝😝 So fucked up at work already Another problem at home again😑 I really hate my room being shifted or touched without my presence😒🙎 Oh ... Making me mad even when I'm home. .... No idea at all .... Chatting with other guys makes me wonder what you're hesitating for. “@AboutVirgos: #Virgos will love you more than any love you have known before.” 💖💛💙💜💚❤️ When is it my turn?👭 http://t.co/0ZMqpnhCug My room is in a total disaster rn😑 No eyes to see the mess. 
I don't want to care anymore. What the fuck is lifeeeee Seriously what is life😒 I only treat you as my big brother. Don't misunderstood us. - "People that laugh alot are very sad inside. Right?"

I wanna get closer to them day by day☺️ Definetely can't live without them❤️ “@nicotineaddixt_: RT @tripjpg im friendly, but im not your friend” Literally scared of being happy now.

Still deciding whether to go jogging anot 😅 I just set the alarm in case “@KenndrickLamar: Overthinking when you're laying in bed at night.” Me rn🙋 Saw you sneezing many times at work jn “@BaeLoveMsg: That moment when he caught you staring at him.” 🙈😳☺️ Goodnight💤🙈 But I don't want to go work also😫 The sight of my room and my workplace makes me feel so sick np // break free // Ariana Grande I'm gonna start to distance myself from you rn.

I don't wanna be alone😫 Double trouble ; triple disappointment How am I gonna survive at work later on without my friends😰😢 Alone🙍 I wanna go west coast park again and see the sea😌 I guess that's the only place that make my heart cool I didn't want this to happen too ... “@BeyonceExplicit: No calls? I understand. No text? I understand. But when you see me with someone else, please understand.” 😕👍 I guess that was the best day I ever had!👍👍 Tired of chasing people now :( No courage to confess though 😕😔✋ Friends all going to quit smoking🚬😅
But I just started😂😂 “@VirgoMindd: #Virgo's are sincere friends until you cross them, then they can be your worse enemy.” Right👍👍 I wanna pee😂😂😂 My mum's gonna be so disappointed if she knows I'm smoking🙊😔 Always being the good girl makes me feel so tired. No one appreciates so why not😏 Omg I just remembered!🙊🙊 I caught you looking at me just now☺️🙊😻 You know ... The fight just now was so intense😅 “Sometimes, things are just better left unsaid.” It's midnight rn I should be sleeping. I could have said and all the things - like 98% of my problems will be solved if I stop overthinking things and calm the fuck down. Please understand me if I don't talk much at times. I hate overthinking. And nothing I do ever seems to be enough for everyone. 
Not even my damn self. "it's easier to bleed my problems out?" I'd bleed to death then. I know I should be happy , because I have so much to be happy for. "why am I still thinking about you?
It's not worth it. 
You're not worth it." Sometimes .... There's nothing wrong with being single. "Being single doesn't mean that I'm weak." Weather so cold 😅 I miss you. “@SweetLoveMsg: Don't rush anything, when the time is right, it will happen.” I'll wait for you. No drama please✋ Why is the bus taking so slow zzzz Why is that scene keep flashing back into my mind? I guess I'm madly deeply truly in love with you☺️ *flashback to 31/12/2014 *that moment when you appeared😳* My heart beat raced. Twitter hacked by lydia “@ItsLifeFact: The best feeling is, when you look at him and he's already looking at you.” Omg I can't imagine😻😻 “@virgo700: #Virgos often hold in emotional conflict and bottles it up until they cannot help but blow or sink into depression.” Yep I'm just gonna seek my own happiness from now on😊👍 Don't make noise if you see me happy with them. They talked to me when they saw me alone. What were you doing then? “@TheLifeDiaries: The worst feeling 😪 http://t.co/rWDhKxBva0” fuck I hate it “@mvirgotweets: #Virgo can think about the same thing for literally hours and hours.” 😉✌️ Starting to feel that there's a chance for both of us😉 I want to ask you this question so much. “@GirITextMsgs: I get re-pissed about an old situation whenever I start thinking about it again.” “@FUCKlNG_PERFECT: When I talk to you, my day gets a whole lot better.” “@SUPER_BlTCH: Missing someone &amp; not being able to see them is the worst feeling ever.” 😭😭😭 “@JustTumbIr: Sometimes all you need, is someone who can make you smile.” ☺️ “@MarilynMonroeDC: Don't assume my tweets are about you. But if you’re affected by them, you're obviously guilty of something.” 😕😒 No point talking to you. Dk what you're so busy with that you can't reply my text. I don't want to stir up another stupid problem. Fuckkkkk ahh Hungry again 😫 Never expect this would happen on me😳 Valentine Day💖 I'm gonna confess on Valentine day. “@TeenagerNotes: Best friends make life so much better.” I hope so🙊 But I'll blush like red apple🍎🙈 Phone battery dying “@FIirtationship: i prefer to distance myself whenever i’m mad because i become the most heartless person you’ll ever meet.” @1997_lydia Hahah cute lah you today😻 He started first not me. No wonder when I came back from the washroom you looked so serious. I guess he saw everything🙈🙊 You're the one I like , not him. “@GirlfriendNotes: I hate the fact that if I don't start the conversation, there won't be one.” OBVIOUSLY😭😭😭 So sleepy &gt;&lt; Eyes so tired. Oh I just woke up 😁 Like I've always said , I treat them both like brothers. And , they're the one who always start to disturb me first😳 I'm not the one who started it. “@MarilynMonroeDC: Once I get you, I don't plan on losing you.” I'm hungry now🙊 My hair smells so nice ~ Don't plan on getting off my bed now 😂 It's ️noisy Day by day .. Craving for twister fries 😻 #nowplaying - would you be there Attention? I don't need it. I didn't know that you'll think of me this way. “@KenndrickLamar: Why hurt a girl who never hurt you?” I've learned to let go of certain things which keep hurting me silently. They are the one who talk to me first. Whatever "attention" I recieves now , is what you both had last time. Forget it. You with your bf I with my friends. Problem? I'm not understanding(?) Everything has changed since you left. You said I don't understand you. How about you? Do this also say do that also say. “@classifiedfact: Psychology says, people who hide their feelings usually care the most.”” That's why always ended up being hurt the most Might as well we be normal friends better. There are many eyes watching , seeing at work. Just that we don't want to say. I wanna stop thinking about this already since it's over. Don't expect me to be there for you. 
When you don't even understand me. You're not worth thinking about. Insults , blaming? “@JustTumbIr: Why stress over something you can't change...” I'm always the one who's at fault and attention seeker. Happy? You want the attention back to you right? But remember. You sure he will be okay with it with other guys talking to you? So fuck it. Let's change the topic. Put yourself in my shoes and I'll put mine in yours. You'll never imagine how I felt when you are always with him.💔 But please think of my feelings also please. How stupid of me ... Once again. Fell asleep just now 😝 Too tired But I can't. Coz you're not mine yet.😔 Talking to my sister is still the best ~ She bring the best out of me. I miss that night. That night where you appeared.

The only place where I can off my mind from overthinking. “@BaeLoveMsg: How can I forget you when your always on my mind.” True though Still learning how to tie fish tail 💪 “@KenndrickLamar: I like it when good unexpected things happen.” 😻🙈 I'm gonna be 18 in 8 months time😱 Am I still young? Lol idk. I considered myself old already.
